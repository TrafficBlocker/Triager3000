Setting Up the Extension:

Right click on the file and select "Extract All"
Open preferred browser--either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome

Microsoft Edge:
    
    1. Type this into your search bar: edge://extensions
    
    2. Enable Developer Mode
    
    3. Load unpacked

    4. Select the unzipped Triager3000 folder

    5. Click Select Folder and now you have the extension in Microsoft Edge!

Google Chrome:

Configuring the Extension:

Hotkeys:
Hotkeys must use a combination of CTRL, ALT, or SHIFT and a letter key. Certain keys and hotkeys such as F5 and Ctrl+C are reserved by the browser so the F1-12 keys will not work and certain hotkeys may not work. 

Using the Extension:
Create a ticket
Do NOT use the 5 - Ticket Creation Template
Do NOT click into the text box
Press the hotkey
Select the issue/sub issue type

Some things to note:
Callback number will sometimes pull the store number. If best callback number is different, change it
